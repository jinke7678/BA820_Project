After initial data cleaning, the report moves into text mining, focusing on isolating English comments with langdetect, resulting in 8,442 non-English entries being filtered out. Subsequent text cleansing standardized comments by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, and whitespace. Tokenization then stripped away stopwords and non-English words, leveraging the NLTK library, to distill meaningful English content for analysis.

The study then employs a word cloud to visualize term frequency, with dominant positive descriptors like "great" and "clean" and location-centric words such as "Boston" standing out, indicating positive guest experiences. This visualization bridges the exploratory phase and the forthcoming topic analysis and model evaluation, setting the stage for deeper insights into themes and sentiments that characterize guest feedback on Boston's Airbnb offerings.
