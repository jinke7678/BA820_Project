Xiang Liu (workload 25%)
Liu Xiang undertook the critical task of cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, ensuring that our data sets were free of inconsistencies and ready for in-depth inspection. This process involved uploading and merging two key CSV files (reviews and listings), carefully formatting the data types for price and date, and applying the "langdetect" feature to filter out non-English reviews. In addition to data cleaning, Xiang also began an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, where she created insightful charts and performed analyzes to reveal trends and patterns in the data. Her work helps determine the impact of the pandemic on review frequency and guest preferences for accommodation types. Mr. Xiang also introduced the data preparation process in detail and contributed to the report, laying a solid foundation for our research.

Yifan Fan (25% workload)
Yifan Fan specializes in text mining, focusing on processing review text to extract meaningful insights. This involves converting all review text to lowercase, removing punctuation, special characters and irrelevant numbers, and then tagging the cleaned text. Yifan's expertise was crucial in vectorizing the text data, a step that significantly improved the quality of the dataset we used for further analysis. She also creatively uses word cloud visualizations to represent our findings, making the data more accessible and understandable. These word clouds highlight common terms found in reviews, revealing the positive aspects of the Boston guest experience.

Jinke Han (25% workload)
Jinke Han's responsibilities focus on conducting topic analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models and evaluating the model's performance. By applying the gensim library, Jinke extracted key topics such as service quality and location from user reviews to gain in-depth insights into what guests value most. She carefully trained the LDA model, tuning it to find the optimal number of topics that balances coherence and complexity. Jinke’s analytical skills were critical in interpreting the model’s results, making a significant contribution to our understanding of thematic structure in Airbnb reviews.

Qianyi Mo (workload 25%)
Mo Qianyi focused on optimizing the LDA model by adjusting the α and eta parameters, which affect the distribution of topics and words respectively. Her work involves conducting sensitivity analyzes to find the best combination of these parameters to maximize thematic coherence. Additionally, Qianyi leveraged Google Colab for advanced visualization, creating engaging and informative graphics to illustrate our findings. She was responsible for drafting the preliminary results section of our report, concisely summarizing the impact of these parameters on model performance and clearly describing our analysis process.
